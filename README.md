## Overview :
-the first api is created where we can make different requests through espress(). and some bookstores

### The challenge

-It was a good challenge, where we handle http requests, with the help of express and connect to the page we need with cors(),

The challenge is to have a table with the help of

"@makeitrealcamp/db-mock" to simulate a database and take the data to our rect project, in this case take it to the console.

## My process


### Built with

-express
-javascript
-cors()
-express.json()

### What I learned


create a pi, where a server communicates with our program in react,
we leave an example:

```js
app.get('/api/hotels', handleGetAllData)

  function handleGetAllData(req, res) {
    console.log('Middleware Controller')
    const records = getAllData()
  
    return res.json(records)
  }

  function getAllData() {
  const records = table.findAll()

  return records
}

```

### Continued development
- I will continue practicing to have a better handling of DOM, studying and consulting my mentors so that every day I improve my knowledge.

 ### Useful resources
